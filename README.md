## Some template
# Journal Entry - [DATE]

## Overview
- **Date**: [Insert Date, e.g., 2025-05-30]
- **Topic**: [Insert Topic, e.g., Markdown Tables]
- **Duration**: [Insert Hours Spent, e.g., 2 hours]
- **Goal**: [Insert Goal, e.g., Learn to create tables in Markdown]

## What I Learned
- [Point 1, e.g., Tables use `|` and `-` for columns and headers.]
- [Point 2, e.g., Misaligned pipes break the table.]
- [Point 3, e.g., GitHub sanitizes HTML styles.]

## Code Snippets
```[LANGUAGE, e.g., python]
# Insert code here, e.g., calculate IQR
import numpy as np
iqr = np.quantile(msleep['sleep_total'], 0.75) - np.quantile(msleep['sleep_total'], 0.25)
print("IQR:", iqr)
```
## Challenges
- [Challenge 1, e.g., Struggled with table alignment.]
- [Challenge 2, e.g., Inline HTML didnâ€™t work as expected.]
